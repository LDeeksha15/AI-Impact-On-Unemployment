# AI Impact on Unemployment (ETL & Analysis Project)

## Project Title
**AI Impact on Unemployment: An ETL and Data Analysis Approach**

## Introduction
This project examines how Artificial Intelligence affects unemployment trends in India. Using **official unemployment datasets (2016–2021)** and **AI job trend data (post-2022)**, it processes and integrates multiple data sources through **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines** to provide insights into job loss, job creation, and job transformation due to AI adoption.

## Objectives
- Perform **ETL on multiple datasets** to clean and standardize employment data.  
- Analyze **unemployment trends before and after AI adoption**.  
- Understand the relationship between **AI-driven job creation** and unemployment.  
- Provide insights for **policy, reskilling, and workforce planning**.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Key Highlights
- ETL pipeline merges **state-level**, **total-level**, and **AI job trend datasets**.  
- Unemployment **increased during post-AI/COVID periods (2020–2021)**.  
- **AI job openings in 2024** suggest large-scale **job transformation rather than job loss**.  
- Visualizations include **stacked bar charts, line charts**, and **trend analysis**.

## Conclusion
- AI leads to **job transformation** rather than complete job elimination.  
- Post-2022 employment outcomes depend on **reskilling, upskilling, and AI readiness**.  
- ETL-based analysis provides a **structured and accurate approach** to integrate multiple datasets for actionable insights.
