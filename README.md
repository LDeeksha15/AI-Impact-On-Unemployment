# AI Impact on Unemployment (India)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes unemployment trends in India before and after the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Official unemployment datasets are used up to 2021, and AI job trend data is used to understand post-2022 employment patterns.

The study focuses on whether AI leads to job loss or job transformation and highlights the importance of workforce adaptation.

## Objectives
- Analyze unemployment trends before AI adoption
- Compare state-level and total-level unemployment rates
- Study AI-driven job creation after 2022
- Understand the future impact of AI on employment

## Datasets Used
- Unemployment in India (State-wise)
- Unemployment upto 11-2022 
- Total Unemployment Rate (National level)
- AI Job Trends Dataset (Post-2022)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights
- Unemployment increased during the 2020–2021 period due to COVID and early AI adoption.
- Post-2022, AI-related job openings show strong growth.
- AI causes job transformation rather than complete job loss.
- Reskilling and upskilling are critical for reducing future unemployment.

## Conclusion
This project concludes that AI is reshaping the job market rather than eliminating jobs.
Future unemployment levels will depend on skill development, education, and AI readiness.
